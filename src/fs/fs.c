 * eventfd, on a system that has none.
 *
 * An eventfd is a counter you can poll: write adds to it, read returns the
 * total and zeroes it, and it is readable exactly while the total is nonzero.
 * Darwin has no equivalent, and nothing here had implemented syscall 19 at all,
 * so it returned ENOSYS - which is what stopped every download in the guest.
 * libcurl's multi interface creates one for curl_multi_wakeup and treats the
 * failure as fatal, so curl_multi_init returned NULL and the tool reported
 * "curl: (27) Out of memory" - about a machine with 32GiB free. pacman 7 and
 * dnf both drive libcurl that way, which is why neither could fetch anything.
 *
 * The pollable part is what needs a real descriptor, so it is a socketpair: the
 * guest is given one end, NABI keeps the other, and a single byte is held in
 * flight whenever the counter is nonzero. That byte is what makes poll, select
 * and epoll answer correctly without any of them knowing this is emulated. The
 * counter itself lives here, because a socketpair queues bytes where an eventfd
 * accumulates a total, and a guest that writes 1 five times must read back 5
 * rather than 1 with four bytes still pending.
 *
 * What does not survive: arm64's fork is fork-plus-exec, and this table is
 * process memory rather than checkpoint state, so a forked child inherits the
 * descriptor without the counter behind it. libcurl creates its eventfd after
 * forking, so no guest yet has needed it to travel; a guest that did would see
 * a socketpair with eventfd's arithmetic missing rather than a broken fd.

 * A signalfd turns a pending signal into a thing to be read. The usual shape:
 * the guest blocks the signals it wants with sigprocmask, creates the signalfd
 * with that set as its mask, and reads the records back. The signal is consumed
 * by the read - this is the only place it is taken out of the pending set - so
 * a signal read here is not also delivered to a handler.
 *
 * Readability is a byte held in flight, as with eventfd: when a signal the
 * descriptor's mask names becomes pending, nabi sends one byte to the far end
 * of the socketpair the guest holds. A blocking read sleeps on that socketpair
 * and is woken either by the byte or by the EINTR the host signal itself
 * produces, and poll, select and epoll answer from the byte without any of them
 * knowing this is emulated.
 *
 * The poke has to survive a signal handler, because __host_signal_handler is
 * the one place a signal becomes pending and that is where nabi pokes from. So
 * the table is a fixed array - never reallocated, which keeps the handler's
 * lock-free scan of it safe - and each poke is a single nonblocking send with
 * MSG_NOSIGNAL, since raising SIGPIPE from inside a signal handler would be a
 * fine way to die. A signal that was already pending when the descriptor came
 * into existence left a bit with no byte behind it, so creation pokes once too;
 * the read loop would have found it either way, poll would not have.
 *
 * As with eventfd, the table is process memory rather than checkpoint state: a
 * forked child inherits the descriptor without the entry that makes it a
 * signalfd, and reads fall through to the plain socket underneath.

 *     by a real filesystem - a directory of files describing the machine's live
 *     state is not something that can be unpacked from a .deb - so when one is
 *     mounted, the host's is the only true answer. Being *mounted* is the test,
 *     because FHS creates these as empty directories at boot whether or not the
 *     module that fills them is installed, and an empty /proc passed through
 *     would mask the rootfs's own while claiming to answer a question we
 *     cannot.
 *
 * What is deliberately not here is the rest of what FHS names - /home, /run,
 * /root, /media, /mnt, /srv. Those are host directories that already have a
 * macOS path, and a rootfs has its own legitimate claim on them; /home in
 * particular must stay the rootfs's own, or the guest's shell reads the host's
 * dotfiles and arrives wearing the host's prompt.
 *
 * /boot used to be here too, on the reasoning that FHS owns the real one and a
 * rootfs cannot know what this machine boots. That was answering a different
 * question from the one a guest asks. A Linux distribution reading /boot wants
 * its own kernel, its own System.map, its own grub.cfg - not the kernel
 * collections macOS boots - and passing the host's through gave a wrong answer
 * to that question while making the right one unreachable:
 *
 *   - Arch Linux ARM ships a kernel, an initramfs and a tree of device trees in
 *     the tarball, and the guest could not see any of it.
 *   - `apt-get install linux-image-arm64` stopped at "unable to create
 *     /boot/System.map-...dpkg-new: Permission denied", because dpkg was
 *     writing into the host's /boot as an ordinary account. A guest package
 *     manager installing a Linux kernel into the Mac's boot directory would
 *     have been worse than the failure.
 *
 * So the guest keeps its own /boot unconditionally. Nothing NABI does boots
 * anything, and the files there are read - by initramfs hooks, by os-prober, by
 * postinsts - rather than executed.
